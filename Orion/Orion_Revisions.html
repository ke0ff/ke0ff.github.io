Revision A (mid-2016): This is the first PCB created to obtain a reasonable</br>
PLL with built-in frequency control.  It made provisions for an
RS-232</br>
transciever (off-board) and switchable reference input (internal or external).</p>

Revision B (March, 2017): This re-spin sought to include several refinements</br>
over the initial design, including an on-board RS-232 transceiver,</br>
an improved reference switch, an on-board 5V regulator,
and a prototype area.</p>

Revision C (April, 2017): This revision corrected the noise problems
introduced by</br>
the RS-232 transceiver's charge-pump circuits.  Provision
to disable the</br>
digital circuits was also provided along with some minor
layout tweaks.</br>
<i>
Note: This version is NOT software compatible with the previous
revisions.</br>
The source code features #defines to identify the target hardware.</br>
Be sure to set this properly if you modify the source code
for a given Orion-I.
