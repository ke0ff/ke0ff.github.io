<h3>Mazda 6 Stereo interface</h3>
This isn't repeater related, it isn't even Ham related.  I spent the last 7 or 8 months working on an ipod interface to my Mazda 6 stereo.
It emulates a Mazda tape deck and allows the factory stereo controls to manipulate some of the ipod remote functions.  It also
provides a direct ipod audio link to the stereo.  I wrote a <a href = "mazda6.pdf">blog-like account</a> of the reverse-engineering
and design process.<p>

I'll post design data when it is ready for prime time...<p>
